### How to set up my django projects :ballot_box_with_check:
1. Clone The Project (Or download zipped file, they are small in size with faster downloads)
2. Go to Project Directory `cd project-name`
3. Create a Virtual Environment `pipenv shell`. This will also activate the Virtual Environment
4. Check the Pipfile to confirm if it's running current python version. If not, edit it to the current python version
5. Install dependencies `pipenv install` then create .env to put your generated secret_key (don't forget to source .env then restart termianl)
6. Migrate Database `python manage.py migrate`
7. Create Super User `python manage.py createsuperuser`
8. Finally, Run The Project `python manage.py runserver` 

### How to Learn from my Javascript projects :ballot_box_with_check:
